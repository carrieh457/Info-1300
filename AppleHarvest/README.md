Redesign a website

---

## Getting started
Navigate into the local folder directory that you would like to store this repository in Terminal / Command Prompt.

Enter the follow code to clone the repository directly onto your computer
```
git clone https://github.com/id96/AppleHarvest
```

## Making Edits
After creating your local edits, just type in the following to push to the master repository so that I can see your changes.
```
git add .
git commit -m 'YOUR MESSAGE HERE'
git push origin master
```
Please do not push an obscene amount of small changes to the repo; try to push when you have completed a feature.

## Updating yourself with my changes
I will be working on this project as well. Before working on a new feature, make sure you pull from the repository so that you get all of my newest edits; this will help us avoid merge conflicts.
```
git pull origin master
```

Have fun mang a mang.
